# CardioMeal

CardioMeal is a mobile application designed to help individuals manage and prevent cardiovascular disease through personalized dietary guidance. Leveraging AI and content-based filtering, the system recommends recipes tailored to each userâ€™s cardiovascular health metrics, dietary preferences, and recent eating habits. Beyond recipe suggestions, CardioMeal allows users to log their meals, monitor nutrient intake, and track health progress through visualizations. The system also sends timely reminders to update health data and alerts users when nutrient limits are exceeded, supporting consistency and informed decision-making. By promoting healthier eating habits and proactive health monitoring, CardioMeal directly contributes to Sustainable Development Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being, empowering users to make smarter food choices and maintain a heart-healthy lifestyle.
